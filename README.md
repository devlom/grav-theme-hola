# Installation

Installing the Hola theme can be done in one of two ways. Our GPM (Grav Package Manager) installation method enables you to quickly and easily install the theme with a simple terminal command, while the manual method enables you to do so via a zip file. 

The theme by itself is useful, but you may have an easier time getting up and running by installing a skeleton. The skeleton can be found in [Hola Skeleton](https://github.com/devlom/grav-skeleton-hola) package which are self-contained repositories for a complete sites which include: sample content, configuration, theme, and plugins.

## GPM Installation (Preferred)

The simplest way to install this theme is via the [Grav Package Manager (GPM)](http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm) through your system's Terminal (also called the command line).  From the root of your Grav install type:

    bin/gpm install hola

This will install the Hola theme into your `/user/themes` directory within Grav. Its files can be found under `/your/site/grav/user/themes/hola`.

## Manual Installation

To install this theme, just download the zip version of this repository and unzip it under `/your/site/grav/user/themes`. Then, rename the folder to `hola`. You can find these files either on [GitHub](https://github.com/devlom/grav-theme-hola) or via [GetGrav.org](http://getgrav.org/downloads/themes).

You should now have all the theme files under

    /your/site/grav/user/themes/hola

To make modifications, you can copy the `user/themes/hola/hola.yaml` file to `user/config/themes/` folder and modify, or you can use the admin plugin.

> NOTE: Do not modify the `user/themes/hola/hola.yaml` file directly or your changes will be lost with any updates

## Custom Logos

To add a custom logo, you should put the log into the `user/themes/hola/images/logo` folder.  Standard image formats are support (`.png`,`.jpg`, `.gif`, `.svg`, etc.).  Then reference the logo via the YAML like so:

```yaml
custom_logo:
    - name: 'my-logo.png'
custom_logo_mobile:
    - name: 'my-mobile-logo.png'    
```

Alternatively, you can you use the drag-n-drop "Custom Logo" field in the Hola theme options.

## Multi-lingual metadata

Hola theme supports metadata for different languages

Copy the metadata you need from [Metadata - Grav Documentation](https://learn.getgrav.org/hints-tips/blogging/metadata) and paste it to your `user/pages/01._home/modular.lang.md`after `onpage_menu: false` for example.
